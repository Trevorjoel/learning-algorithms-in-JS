 **Lesson 2** Harmless Ransom Note
 
 Big o notation shows us how an algorithm performs - RUNTIME or time
 complexity.
  
  A constant runtime is when the algorithm runs as the input size
  increases the number of operations that is performed never changes.
  Big O notation: **O(1)**.
  
  A linear runtime is **O(n)** - This means that as the running time
  increases at most linearly with the size of the input. EXAMPLE if the
  algorithm performs an operation on each element in an array then the
  run time increases proportionately to the size of the input array.
  
  Exponential runtime **O (n^2)** - As we add one element to the input
  the runtime make an exponential increase. Example: If the algorithm
  must perform an operation on each element in the array and array of 3
  would require 9 operations, an 4 would be 16 and so on.
  
  Logarithmic runtime **0 (log n)** As the number of inputs grow the
  runtime will not grow proportionately but logarithmically. This is the
  divide and conquer method.
